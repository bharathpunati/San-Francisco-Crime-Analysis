# San-Francisco-Crime-Analysis

Crime rate in San Francisco has been steadily increasing throughout the years and with the surge in COVID cases and crisis hitting hard, people have chosen to earn money or exploit people. In this project,  I built a dashboard displaying the crime in various districts of San Francisco with a drop down menu to provide tourists an idea and watch out. I performed EDA using ggplot2 and matplotlib and developed the web application for dashboard using Rshiny's server and ui .
